// For the tacos: 12 corn tortillas
// 1 cup finely chopped white onion
// ¼ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
// Lime wedges (for serving)
// Directions
// Make the beef:
// Season short ribs generously with salt and place in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add water to cover by 2". Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, skimming any foam that rises to the surface, until meat is tender, 2–2½ hours. Transfer meat to a plate and let cool slightly. Shred meat into bite-size pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat or gristle. Set aside.
// Do Ahead: Beef can be cooked 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
// Make the chile sauce:
// Place guajillo, ancho, and pasilla chiles in a medium bowl; cover with boiling water. Let sit until chiles are softened,
// 25–30 minutes. Drain, reserving soaking liquid.

// Meanwhile, toast oregano, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon in a small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a blender and add salt, black pepper, cloves, ginger, allspice, turmeric, cayenne, annatto, canela, chocolate, coffee, star anise, fennel, fenugreek, nutmeg, cardamom, white pepper, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorns, coriander, cumin, caraway, celery seed, mustard seed, sumac, paprika, Aleppo pepper, urfa biber, berbere, chipotle, pasilla, ancho, guajillo, New Mexico, California, and Hatch chiles. Blend, adding soaking liquid by the tablespoonful as needed, until a smooth paste forms. Set chile paste aside.
// Do Ahead: Chile paste can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
// Make the tacos:
// Heat a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Working in batches, warm tortillas in a single layer, turning occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, about 1 minute per batch. Stack tortillas and keep warm in a clean kitchen towel.
// Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chile paste and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups reserved beef cooking liquid and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and reduced by half,
// 15–20 minutes. Add shredded beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick and coats beef,
// 5–8 minutes. Season with salt.
// Serve beef in tortillas, topped with onion and cilantro and lime wedges alongside.

// Ingredients
// For the dough: 1 cup whole milk
// 1 (¼-ounce) envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)
// ¼ cup granulated sugar
// 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
// 1 teaspoon kosher salt
// 3 large eggs, room temperature
// 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature, plus more for greasing
// For the filling and assembly:
// ¾ cup (packed) light brown sugar

// 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
// ½ teaspoon kosher salt
// 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
// 1 large egg, beaten to blend
// For the glaze: 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
// 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
// 1 cup powdered sugar
// ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
// Pinch of kosher salt
// Directions
// Make the dough:
// Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium or in a microwave until an instant-read thermometer registers 110°–115°. Transfer milk to a 2-cup measuring glass; stir in yeast and 1 tsp. sugar. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
// Whisk together flour, salt, and remaining ¼ cup sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add eggs and yeast mixture and mix on low speed until nearly combined, about 30 seconds. Switch to the dough hook and add 10 Tbsp. butter; mix until butter is almost completely incorporated, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium and beat until dough is soft and slightly sticky, about 8 minutes.
// Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until smooth. Shape into a ball. Butter a large bowl and add dough, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size,
// 45–60 minutes.
// Make the filling and assemble:
// Whisk brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl.
// Punch down dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Roll out to a 16x12" rectangle. Spread butter over dough, leaving a ½" border. Sprinkle cinnamon mixture over. Starting at a long end, roll up dough, jelly-roll style, into a log. Pinch seam to seal. Cut crosswise into 12 pieces.
// Lightly coat a 9x13" baking dish with butter. Arrange pieces, cut side up, in prepared dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 45–60 minutes.
// Preheat oven to 350°. Brush dough with egg. Bake until golden brown and rolls are baked through,
// 25–30 minutes.
// Make the glaze:
// Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt and beat on low speed until incorporated. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
// Spread glaze over warm rolls. Serve warm or at room temperature.

// Pour oil into a large heavy pot fitted with thermometer to come halfway up sides. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°. Working in batches, fry doughnuts, turning occasionally, until deep golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly.
// Using a paring knife, poke a hole in the side of each doughnut. Transfer pastry cream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe pastry cream into doughnuts until filled. Dip tops of doughnuts into chocolate glaze and return to rack. Let sit until glaze is set, about 30 minutes.
