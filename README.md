Recipe Sharing Platform

The Recipe Sharing Platform is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse, share, and save recipes. The application is built using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Azure. It also includes machine learning features that provide personalized recipe recommendations based on user behavior.

Features
Browse recipes by category, cuisine, or dietary preference
Search for recipes by keyword
Create and share your own recipes
Save recipes to your personal collection
Follow other users and discover new recipes
Like, comment, and rate recipes
Personalized recipe recommendations based on your interests and behavior
The personalized recipe recommendations are generated using machine learning algorithms that analyze user behavior on the platform. The algorithms consider factors such as the user's search history, saved recipes, and ratings, as well as the popularity and relevance of the recipes.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
